# Privacy Policy
This is the privacy policy for the extension DashBlox.\
You will find information about how your data is handled with DashBlox.

# Browsers
DashBlox is only intended to be used on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, it might work fine on other chromium based browsers. You can find more information about compatibility with browsers [here](https://github.com/WingedDash/DashBlox/blob/master/ReadMe.md#DashBlox).

# DashBlox
[DashBlox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogffnhpicoghhpcbememhijlbdejchjb) is an extension that creates new features that otherwise are missing, removed, or don't exist for [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/).

# Data Collection
DashBlox does not collect any of your data.

# Roblox Site Access
DashBlox has full access to the Roblox API, which allows it to fetch the data it needs to modify the website and display all the features DashBlox has to offer.

Here are some examples that DashBlox will be able to access:
* Basic information you provided to Roblox.
     * (UserId, Display Name, Username)
* The Ids of the pages visit on Roblox.
    * (AssetId, GameId, GamePassId, GroupId)
* Change the way the website looks and behaves.
* Read and change data on Roblox.

DashBlox does __not__ collect any of the data it uses on the Roblox site, it's only going to use [locally stored data](#chrome-storage) to add features the user wants on a specific page.

# Chrome Storage
DashBlox uses __chrome storage__ to store data locally, which is where all of DashBlox's settings are stored.\
Since the data is stored locally, if DashBlox gets reinstalled, all of your settings will be reset to the default values.

# Host Permissions
DashBlox uses the following host permissions:
* `storage`
    * The usage of this permission is explained in [Chrome Storage](#chrome-storage).
* `*://*.roblox.com/*`
    * This host permission allows DashBlox to access Roblox's site and apis.

# Optional Permissions
DashBlox currently doesn't use any optional permissions, although some might be added in the future for a better user experience.
