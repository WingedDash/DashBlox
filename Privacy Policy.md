# Privacy Policy
This is the privacy policy for the extension DashBlox. This provides information about how your data is handled with DashBlox. If there are any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you can contact me [here](https://github.com/WingedDash/DashBlox/blob/dev/ReadMe.md#contact-information)

## Data Collection
DashBlox does not collect any of your data.

## Browser Compatibility
DashBlox is designed to be used on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. While DashBlox might work on other Chromium-based browsers. I am not responsible for any issues that might arise from using unintended browsers. You can find more information about browser compatibility [here](https://github.com/WingedDash/DashBlox/blob/dev/ReadMe.md#DashBlox).

<!-- # DashBlox
[DashBlox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogffnhpicoghhpcbememhijlbdejchjb) is an extension that creates new features that otherwise are missing, removed, or don't exist for [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/). -->

## Roblox Site Access
DashBlox has full access to the Roblox Api, which allows it to fetch the data it needs to modify the website and display all the features DashBlox has to offer.

Here are some examples that DashBlox will be able to access:
* Basic information you provided to Roblox.
     * (UserId, Display Name, Username)
* The Ids of the pages visit on Roblox.
    * (AssetId, GameId, GamePassId, GroupId)
* Change the way the website looks and behaves.
* Read and change data on Roblox.

DashBlox does __not__ collect any of the data it uses on the Roblox site.\
It only uses locally stored data to add features the user wants on a specific page, as explained [here](#chrome-storage).

## Chrome Storage
DashBlox uses __chrome storage__ to store data locally, which is where all of DashBlox's settings and data are stored. Since the data is stored locally, if DashBlox gets reinstalled, all of your settings will be reset to the default values.

## Host Permissions
DashBlox uses the following host permissions:
* `storage`
    * The usage of this permission is explained in [Chrome Storage](#chrome-storage).
* `*://*.roblox.com/*`
    * This host permission allows DashBlox to access Roblox's site and apis.

<!-- # Optional Permissions
DashBlox currently doesn't use any optional permissions, although some might be added in the future for a better user experience. -->

## Disclaimers and Liability
I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using DashBlox, including but not limited to data loss, security breaches, or browser compatibility problems. By using DashBlox, you acknowledge and agree that I am not liable for any damages or losses.

## User Consent
By using DashBlox, you consent to this privacy policy. I reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time. Any changes will be posted here, and continued use of the extension implies acceptance of the updated policy.
